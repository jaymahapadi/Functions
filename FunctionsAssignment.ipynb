        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "  - A function is a block of reusable code defined using the def keyword, which can exist independently of any object.\n",
        "  - A method is a function that is associated with an object (usually a class instance) and operates on that object.\n",
        "  - Function is defined at module  level and method is defined in class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "  - Parameters are variables declared during function declaration.\n",
        "  - Arguments are values passed to declared function parameters.These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters.\n",
        "\n",

        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "    - An iterable is any object in Python that can be looped over (iterated through) using a for loop.\n",

        "\n",

        "    - Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions and the yield keyword instead of returning values.\n",

        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "    - The map() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.) and return a map object (which is an iterator) of the results.\n",

        "    - The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (an iterator)\n",
        "    - The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
        "    - The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value. It is part of the functools module\n",
